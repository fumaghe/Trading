GOAT stands for \u201cGreatest Of All Tokens,\u201d capturing the spirit of playful irreverence that has long fueled the success of meme coins across the broader crypto space.\r\n\r\nWhat makes GOAT unique is its commitment to simplicity, humor, and accessibility. It has no complex whitepaper, no promises of futuristic utility, and no roadmap filled with buzzwords. Instead, GOAT embraces the raw, viral power of online communities \u2014 a grassroots movement built by holders, traders, and creators who simply enjoy being part of something fun.\r\n\r\nDeployed on XRPL, GOAT benefits from the network\u2019s speed, low transaction costs, and carbon-neutral infrastructure. These technical advantages make it ideal for fast, feeless trading and meme-fueled momentum within the XRP Ledger\u2019s expanding ecosystem. Despite being a meme coin, GOAT is built on secure and efficient blockchain infrastructure, allowing it to move quickly and scale with community demand.\r\n\r\nGOAT is not affiliated with any official project, company, or development team. It carries no inherent utility and is not intended to serve as a financial product, governance asset, or payment mechanism. It is purely symbolic \u2014 a digital collectible that thrives on culture, creativity, and community.\r\n\r\nBy design, GOAT does not attempt to compete with utility-driven tokens. Its value comes from participation, social energy, and the memes created by its holders. While it may be lighthearted in nature, GOAT aims to foster real engagement, interaction, and good-natured fun within the XRPL space.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a longtime XRPL user or simply love a good meme, GOAT is a reminder that crypto can be weird, wild, and entertaining \u2014 and that sometimes the most valuable tokens are the ones that don\u2019t take themselves too seriously."}, "links": {"homepage": ["http://goatxrp.io/"], "whitepaper": "", "blockchain_site": ["https://xrpscan.com/token/474F415400000000000000000000000000000000.r96Ny5BTU3z4Aw4BfiMJ7RTgDa5iE17u9t", "https://livenet.xrpl.org/token/474F415400000000000000000000000000000000.r96Ny5BTU3z4Aw4BfiMJ7RTgDa5iE17u9t"], "official_forum_url": [], "chat_url": [], "announcement_url": [], "snapshot_url": null, "twitter_screen_name": "Goat_CoinXRP", "facebook_username": "", "bitcointalk_thread_identifier": null, "telegram_channel_identifier": "Goat_CoinXRP", "subreddit_url": null, "repos_url": {"github": [], "bitbucket": []}}, "image": {"thumb": "https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/55460/thumb/Goat_Coin_-_Small_200x200.png?1746126397", "small": "https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/55460/small/Goat_Coin_-_Small_200x200.png?1746126397", "large": "https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/55460/large/Goat_Coin_-_Small_200x200.png?1746126397"}, "country_origin": "", "genesis_date": null, "contract_address": "474F415400000000000000000000000000000000.r96Ny5BTU3z4Aw4BfiMJ7RTgDa5iE17u9t", "sentiment_votes_up_percentage": null, "sentiment_votes_down_percentage": null, "watchlist_portfolio_users": 47, "market_cap_rank": null, "status_updates": [], "last_updated": "2025-10-06T22:07:24.744Z", "tickers": [{"base": "474F415400000000000000000000000000000000.R96NY5BTU3Z4AW4BFIMJ7RTGDA5IE17U9T", "target": "XRP", "market": {"name": "First Ledger", "identifier": "first-ledger", "has_trading_incentive": false}, "last": 5.594602642e-07, "volume": 20600729.1165209, "converted_last": {"btc": 1.3443e-11, "eth": 3.58267e-10, "usd": 1.68e-06}, "converted_volume": {"btc": 0.000277, "eth": 0.00738264, "usd": 34.7}, "trust_score": "red", "bid_ask_spread_percentage": 0.604581, "timestamp": "2025-10-06T19:19:56+00:00", "last_traded_at": "2025-10-06T19:19:56+00:00", "last_fetch_at": "2025-10-06T22:06:46+00:00", "is_anomaly": false, "is_stale": false, "trade_url": null, "token_info_url": null, "coin_id": "goat", "target_coin_id": "ripple", "coin_mcap_usd": 0.0}]}
